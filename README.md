# Desktop Ansible Playbook
This playbook is meant to automate the first time setup process for my PCs. It has been specifically written for Fedora.

## Libraries
As I'm new to Ansible, I'm going to be installing the libraries into the ```library``` directory and adding it to this repo. This may change in the future as I get better at Ansible.

## Installation
### Ansible
```bash
sudo dnf install ansible
```

### Playbook
```bash
temp
```

## Running the playbook
```bash
PLACEHOLDER
```
